  <h1>Why We Visualize Data</h1>
  <p>
    The best way to understand how things work is to disect them. To change them, to play with them, to implement them, and to break them. I love thinking about algorithms. How can we understand them better? How can we make them better? How can they make us better?
    To do this I very much believe that one important step is to understand what data looks like. How it behaves. How algorithms move and manipulate patterns.
    To do this I use <a href="https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0" target='blank'>visualizations</a> This site is a collection of those visualizations.
    They exist in many formats, orientations and settings because data dictates patterns. And different representations give rise to different patterns. The result of running a sort on reversed data is
    very different then the result of running the same code on ordered data. In these patterns we can find beauty and insight, and if we are lucky we
    can begin to understand the magic. But I make no promises.
