        <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>

        <p>
            Bubble sort is one of the most controversial sorting algorithms.
            It's extremely inefficent, and it has been argued, that it shouldn't be taught in CS courses.
            This is discussed more fully in <a href='https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/bubble/bubble.html'>Bubble Sort: An Archaeological Algorithmic Analysis</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>How Bubble Sort Works</h4>

        <p>
            Bubble Sort is an exchange sort.
            It is named for the way that larger elements bubble up to the end of the list.
            The algorithm is very simple, but it is also very inefficent.
            There are various optimizations that can make bubble sort extremely efficient for almost sorted lists.
            However, other sorts exist have similar performance on ordered lists,
            and better performance on other orders.
        </p>

        <h4>Performance</h4>

        <p>
            Bubble sort has a worst-case complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) and an average case complexity of О(n<sup>2</sup>).
            If the sort is implemented with a short circuit for a presorted list there is a best case complexity of Ω(n).
        </p>

        <h4>Code Sample</h4>

        <h5>Python</h5>

        <pre><code class="python">
    def bubble_sort(nums):
        # Repeat the sort up to n - 1 times
        # if there are 5 elements. It will run the sort 4 times.
        # At minimum this will put 4 of the 5 elements in place.
        # And the array will become sorted.
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            # set a variable to check if the array is ordered
            ordered = True
            # For each round look at every number up to the second to last that has not been sorted.
            # We do not need to reconsider the final number of the previous round
            # because bubble sort always puts the highest number in the last position each round.
            for index in range(len(nums) - i):
                # compare each value to the next value in the array.
                # if the next value is smaller swap the values
                value = nums[index]
                next_value = nums[index + 1]
                if next_value < value:
                    nums[index], nums[index + 1] = next_value, value
                    # if you had to swap change the ordered variable
                    ordered = False
            # if the array was ordered break out of the loop
            if ordered:
                break
        # return the sorted array
        return nums
