                    <h1>Summary</h1>

                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_sort" target="_blank">Comb Sort</a> is an attempt to take advantage of the fact that many sorts are more effective on a partially sorted list. It improves upon sorts like <a href="./bubble.html">Bubble Sort</a> by first attempting to transform the list into a mostly ordered list.</p>

                        <p>
                            The algorithm works by attempting to eliminate turtles. It does this by comparing values across intervals before descending into a traditional Bubble Sort. Comb uses a "shrink factor" to determine the gap. The recommended shrink is 1.3 which was recommended based on tests of 200,000 lists. This balances between too small values which move slowly down to a gap of 1 and end up making too many comparisons, and large values whose gap falls too quickly and doesn't adequately deal with turtles. There is some similarity with <a href="./shell.html">Shell Sort</a>, but unlike Shell, Comb Sort does not fully sort each gap size before moving on.

                    <div id="shrink" class="four"></div>

                    <p>
                        As stated above the suggested ideal shrink is 1.3. There are several versions which are implemented in the sort testers. Above we can see shrinks 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, and 2. We good performance on the 1.5 version in many cases. But we see the problems clearly with 1.1 and 2.0.

                    <h1>Comparing Efficency Among Orderings</h1>

                    <div id="order" class="four"></div>

                    <p>
                        When we look at Comb on different kinds of data we see that there is an efficency loss over sorts like <a href="./bubble.html">Bubble Sort</a>. This is because Comb has to complete enough rounds to get to a gap of 1 before it can short circuit. But on random and reversed orders it is able to quickly get elements close to the array.

                     <p>
                        When we look at Comb Sort we see some of the same potential problems as <a href="./bubble.html">Bubble Sort</a>. We can attempt to solve this by not devolving to Bubble Sort but switching to another sort. For example, the last 3 sorts above switch from Comb to <a href="./gnome.html">Gnome Sort</a> at various gaps(3, 5, 10 respectively). All of these tend to work faster than the traditional Comb sort. That is because it saves us from having to run multiple rounds to move items into place if they need to move down.
