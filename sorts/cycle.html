                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <div class="normal clear">

                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sort" target="_blank">Cycle Sort</a> is an unstable sorting algorithm that optimizes for the number of writes that need to done. Unlike other sorts the items are only ever written to the location that they go in the array, so they are written either 0 or 1 times.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The sort runs by looking at each element in array in order. It then iterates over the rest of the array and counts the number of elements smaller than the given element. If there are no smaller elements it inserts the element into the current location. Otherwise it inserts the element into the correct location and restarts the process that was in that location. If the value in the location that you need to insert is equal to the value you want to insert insert it in the first location with a different value. This continues until you insert a value into the current location. Then you move on to the next element in the array.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The sort ends when you complete a cycle for the last element in the array.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This sort will always be at least O(n<sup>2</sup>). It cannot be optimized beyond that as each element has to be determined to be placed.
                        </p>

                    <p>In order to optmize Cycle Sort we can skip over items that we have previously placed. Since we only place items in the correct location we don't need to check another time if we placed the item during a previous cycle.</p>
