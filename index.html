        <h3>Why We Visualize Data</h3>
        <p>
            This is a site mostly built for me. Why build it? Well I find the best way to understand how things work is to really look at them.
            To change them, to play with them, to implement them, and to edit them. I love algorithms. I do things with them on a daily basis.
            I love to consider them to read about them, and to think about them. And although we do not as programmers implement many kinds algorithms on a daily basis.
            (I'm not going to implement a sort when the language has a perfectly good one built it.) I believe it's important to know what the language is doing under the hood.
            So I spend a lot of time playing with algorithms. How can we make them better? How can we understand them better?
            To do this I very much believe that one important step is to understand what data looks like. How it behaves. How algorithms move and manipulate patterns.
            To do this I use <a href="https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0">visualizations</a> This site is a collection of those visualizations.
            They exist in many formats, orientations and settings because data dictates patterns. The result of running a sort of reversed data is
            very different then the result of running the same code on ordered data. In these patterns we can find beauty and insight, and if we are lucky we
            can begin to understand the magic. But I make no promises.
        </p>

        <h3>Sorting Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            One way to evaluate algorithms data patterns is to compare algorithms. That can be done on the sort <a href="sort_comparison.html">comparison page</a>.
